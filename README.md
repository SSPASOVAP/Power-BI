# Power-BI
Sample Power BI Projects
# Those Projects help to understand Power Query M, DAX & Power BI basics
Iâ€™ve created them based on academy exercises during my education. 
The idea is showing a way of building BI Dashboard from the very beginning to the end. 
How to maintain raw data, normalize it and make it applicable for DAX calculation and measure creation to support the data visualization through a Power BI.
I would gladly accept guidelines from others for developing the Power Query M and DAX codes for being more efficient and optimized, same as suggestions for improving the dashboards design.
# A Project Content 
- Raw Data used for the project
- Power Query M script for normalizing data 
- Building fact and dimension tables
