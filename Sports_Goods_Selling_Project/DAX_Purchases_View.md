	### Some dependencies that can be highlighted based on the DATA we worked with:
-- 1. Products coming from category: accessories, same as the bikes are among the most seller.
-- 2. Customers with the most orders and on highest amonunt are in the age group of 31 - 40.
-- 3. Customers having 3-4 cars buy significantly less. Having the fact we sell bikes and sport goods, 
		-- we can guess those are not so active ppl.
-- 4. Man have more orders but on less amount compared to those on the women.
-- 5. Family clients have more orders and on higher amount. 
-- 6. Customers without children buy more than others, and they also represent the highest percentage among the clients network.
-- 7. Customers having 1,2 or 5 kids buy more than those having 3 - 4.
-- 8. Sport-100 and Water Bottle are among most buying products from all clients
-- 9. Women buy more bikes while men buy more clothes.
-- 10. Customers coming from Professional & Skilled Manual, are formed a bit over 50% from all purchases.
-- 11. Customers with yearly incomes between 30 Ð¸ 70K are formed a bit over 50% from all purchases.
-- 12. In general customers with lower incomes (Below 100K, where MAX = 170K) are buying more, 
	-- but they are also formed a higher percentage compared to those who are taking over 100K.
